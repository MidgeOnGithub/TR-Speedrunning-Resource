The Excel workbook provided in the release package is intended to provide an intuitive, interactive, robust user interface and experience. The usage of Excel is not meant as an endorsement nor representation of sponsorship of Microsoft Office products or Microsoft in general.

Much of the basics of operating the file are listed in the Information worksheet of the workbook. The file is intended to be intelligible to both a "pro" speedrunner and a complete newcomer. The tool in no way directly affects any speedruns. The Excel file operates as its own process and performs no reading, writing, hooking, etc. to the Tomb Raider games. It acts completely independent from the gameplay.

Thus, this workbook is useful *outside* of runs to help a runner plan or optimize their routes. There are sheets that accompany all major run types: Any%, Secrets%, 100%/Max%, and all Glitchless variations. Within these sheets are also version toggles to account for any difference in enemy, item, or weapon behavior due to using a different version of the game (most notably, some Japanese versions of the classic TR games are made easier by weapon damage output modifications for Japanese-localized game versions).

##### Unimplemented Features Needed Before Official Release

* Prompted, automatic ammo calculations
	* The player will be prompted to choose what weapons they are choosing to kill which enemies. These values will be stored in archive sheets within the workbook, thus retaining a history of the player's choices that can be reloaded upon program close and re-opening.
* Flares tracking and/or optimizing sheets

##### Future Features to be Added After Official Release

* Support for games Tomb Raider I and Tomb Raider III

* Possible integration/implementation alongside TRView?
	* https://github.com/chreden/trview/
	
* Possible code conversion to Non-Microsoft spreadsheet programs/languages? (Unlikely)
